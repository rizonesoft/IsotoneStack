## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Git
- Python 3.11+
- PowerShell 5.1+
- Administrator privileges

## Coding Standards

### PowerShell

- Use approved verbs (Get-, Set-, Start-, Stop-, etc.)
- Include comment-based help for functions
- Handle errors with try/catch
- Use `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`

```powershell
function Start-IsotoneService {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Starts an IsotoneStack service
    
    .PARAMETER ServiceName
    The name of the service to start
    #>
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$ServiceName
    )
    
    try {
        Start-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction Stop
        Write-Host "Service $ServiceName started successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to start service: $_"
    }
}
```

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

```python
def create_service_widget(
    parent: ctk.CTkFrame,
    service_name: str,
    service_id: str
) -> ctk.CTkFrame:
    """
    Create a service control widget.
    
    Args:
        parent: Parent frame
        service_name: Display name of the service
        service_id: Internal service identifier
        
    Returns:
        The created widget frame
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Examples:
- `Add virtual host drag-drop functionality`
- `Fix Apache service startup timeout issue`
- `Update PHP to version 8.3.15`
- `Refactor service monitor for better performance`
